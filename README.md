## Project Description

This repository contains a series of exercises and a CRUD project where I put into practice the use of advanced data structures in JavaScript, including objects, arrays, sets, and maps.
The goal is to efficiently organize, store, and manipulate data while following best programming practices.

Additionally, JSON Server is used to simulate a REST API, enabling real-world Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations with persistent data during development.
